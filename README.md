# ðŸ“š Minimal Library Management System

A clean and functional **frontend application** for managing a library, built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)**, and **TypeScript**. This project is focused on core book and borrowing features and interacts seamlessly with a RESTful API. It does **not** include authentication, category filters, or payment integration, keeping things minimal and efficient.
